## 🚀 Project Overview

> **Critical Finding**: While 12 million youth enter India's workforce annually, 90% choose careers blindly due to inadequate guidance, creating massive skill gaps (up to 88.9% in emerging sectors) that threaten economic growth.

This comprehensive data-driven analysis examines India's demographic dividend through three critical lenses:
- 📊 **Youth Workforce Entry Trends** (2018-2025)
- 🏭 **Industry Skill Gaps** across 8 major sectors
- 🎓 **Student Career Guidance Crisis** and decision journey breakdowns

<sup>
  <kbd>
    <b>Impact:</b> 
    Research reveals that only 6.82% of students successfully navigate from career exploration to informed implementation, while critical industries face worker shortages ranging from 25.6% (IT) to 88.9% (Renewable Energy).
